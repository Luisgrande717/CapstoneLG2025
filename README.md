Our Lady of Fatima Parish Website (MERN Stack)
 Purpose
This project is a bilingual, community-focused website built to serve the Our Lady of Fatima parish. It features mass schedules, upcoming events, and easy navigation—all designed for accessibility and spiritual engagement.
The site uses a modular React frontend and is evolving into a full MERN-stack application with spiritual content automation, admin tools, and community impact at its core.
